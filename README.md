## Project Title - Restaurant Reviews

### Introduction:

This is my submission as part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. The application is called **Restaurant Reviews**.

The initial design was static, had no accessibility, was also not responsive and lacked offline visibility.

###  The Project Rubric:

After cloning the project from the initial repository[mws-restaurant-stage-1](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1), the project was completed following Udacity's project rubric.[Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view).

## Instructions:

Should you wish to clone this repository, bear in mind that a local server should be run in the terminal using python.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

To see the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
